# 📖 About the Project

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a Deep Learning technique that generates artistic images by combining the **content of one image** with the **style of another**.

This project provides a user-friendly web application where users can:

- Upload a content image
- Upload a style image
- Adjust the style intensity
- Generate an artistic image
- Download the stylized result

The application is built using **Flask** for the web interface and **PyTorch** for deep learning inference.

# ✨ Features

- 🖼 Upload Content Image
- 🎨 Upload Style Image
- 🎛 Adjustable Style Strength
- ⚡ Fast Image Generation
- 📥 Download Generated Image
- 💻 Responsive User Interface
- 🧠 Powered by PyTorch Deep Learning
- ☁ Docker & Cloud Deployment Ready

# 🛠 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|-----------|--------------|
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap |
| Backend | Flask |
| Deep Learning | PyTorch, TorchVision |
| Image Processing | Pillow |
| Deployment | Docker, Render |
| Version Control | Git, GitHub |

# 🧠 How It Works

1. Upload a **Content Image**.
2. Upload a **Style Image**.
3. Adjust the **Style Strength**.
4. Click **Generate**.
5. The model extracts content and style features.
6. Adaptive Instance Normalization combines both representations.
7. Download the generated artistic image.
